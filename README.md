## Event details :

- Hacktoberfest® is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.

- Hacktoberfest is a celebration open to everyone in our global community.
- Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.
- You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

## HacktoberFest Rules :

To earn your Hacktoberfest tee or tree reward, you must register and make four valid pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 40,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will be eligible to receive a prize.

Some Basic Program in Various Languages.


#### Update your Repository with main

Add the remote, call it "upstream" :

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/sammyBrokeTheWeb/freecodedatabase
```

 Fetch all the branches of that remote into remote-tracking branches,
 such as upstream/main:

```bash
git fetch upstream 
```

Make sure that you're on your main branch:

```bash
git checkout main 
```

Rewrite your main branch so that any commits of yours that
aren't already in upstream/main are replayed on top of that
other branch:

```bash
git rebase upstream/main
```
